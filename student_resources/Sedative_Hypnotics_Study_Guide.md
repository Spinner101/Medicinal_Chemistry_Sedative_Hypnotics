# Study Guide — Medicinal Chemistry of Sedative–Hypnotics
(PHA 548 • PY1 PharmD)

This guide emphasizes **how to think**, not what to memorize.

---

## I. Big Picture Framework (Memorize This)

All sedative–hypnotics can be understood by answering:

1. What **pathway** is targeted?
2. What **pharmacophore** is required?
3. How do **physicochemical properties** affect CNS entry?
4. How does **metabolism** determine duration?
5. How does structure guide **therapeutic choice**?

## II. Sleep Control Pathways

| Pathway | Drug Classes | Core Idea |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Inhibition | BZDs, Z-drugs, barbiturates | Increase GABA effect |
| Wake drive | Orexin antagonists | Remove arousal signal |
| Timing | Melatonin agonists | Reset circadian rhythm |

---

## III. Benzodiazepines — High-Yield Rules

- Bind **α–γ interface** (allosteric)
- Increase **frequency** of channel opening
- Require endogenous GABA
- **C7 EWG required** for potency
- **3-OH = safer clearance**
- Active metabolites = long duration

**Exam tip:**  
If liver disease or elderly → think **temazepam / lorazepam / oxazepam**

---

## IV. Z-Drugs — Design Logic

- Different scaffold, same BZD site
- Prefer **α1** → hypnosis
- Designed to control **duration**, not potency
- Minimal active metabolites

| Drug | Use |
|----|----|
| Zolpidem | Sleep onset |
| Zaleplon | Middle-of-night |
| Eszopiclone | Sleep maintenance |

## V. Alternative Pathways

### Melatonin Agonists
- MT1 / MT2 GPCRs
- **Timing-dependent**
- Not sedatives

### Orexin Antagonists
- Block wake drive
- Preserve sleep architecture
- Less amnesia

### Barbiturates
- Increase **duration**
- Direct channel gating
- Narrow TI → high risk

## VI. Common Exam Traps

❌ “Sedation = restorative sleep”  
❌ “Z-drugs are non-addictive”  
❌ “Melatonin works regardless of dosing time”  
❌ “Short half-life always equals safe”

---

## VII. Final Exam Strategy

When stuck:
1. Identify pathway
2. Identify PK liabilities
3. Eliminate drugs with active metabolites
4. Choose structure that matches patient context

> **Medicinal chemistry is applied reasoning, not memorization.**
