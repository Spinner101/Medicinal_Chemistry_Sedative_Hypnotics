# Student Worksheet — Lecture 01 — Benzodiazepine Sedative-Hypnotics

Use the figures and tables posted in Canvas/GitHub to answer the questions below.
You are **not required** to run any code.

## A. Figures to Review
- figures/drug_target_map.png
- PubChem structure PNGs for lecture drugs (provided by instructor)

## B. Tables to Review
- data/sar_table.csv
- data/metabolism_table.csv

## C. Questions (Structure → Interaction → Metabolism → Decision)
1. Identify the **pharmacophore elements** highlighted in the structures. Which features are required vs modifiable?
2. Using the drug–target map, explain the **binding site** (orthosteric vs allosteric) and the functional consequence.
3. From the metabolism table, identify the likely **site(s) of metabolism** (e.g., N-dealkylation liability, ester soft spot, glucuronidation handle).
4. Predict which agent(s) would have higher **next-day impairment risk** and justify using PK/metabolism logic.
5. Clinical decision: choose the best option for each scenario and justify chemically:
   - a) Elderly patient with fall risk
   - b) Hepatic impairment
   - c) Middle-of-the-night awakening
   - d) Circadian rhythm disorder
6. Misconception check: write one sentence correcting a common misconception about this class (e.g., 'sedation = restorative sleep').

## D. Optional Extension (Honors)
- Compare two drugs in this lecture: propose **one structural modification** that would likely shorten duration, and explain why.
