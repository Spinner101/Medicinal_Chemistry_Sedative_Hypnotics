## Teaching Innovation and Effectiveness  
### (Hampton University Context)

In alignment with Hampton University’s mission to provide rigorous, student-centered education that integrates foundational knowledge with professional preparation, I developed a public-facing medicinal chemistry teaching repository focused on sedative–hypnotic drugs for PY1 PharmD learners. This instructional resource emphasizes the chemical basis of drug action and behavior in vivo and in vitro, explicitly connecting pharmacophore recognition, physicochemical properties, structure–activity relationships, drug–receptor interactions, and metabolism to therapeutic decision-making.

The repository is organized by therapeutic area and designed to promote deep conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization. Instructional materials include modular lectures, case-based learning activities, Bloom’s-aligned assessments, and an integrative capstone exam that collectively support active learning and higher-order cognitive development. This work reflects a commitment to inclusive excellence by providing transparent learning scaffolds, explicitly addressing common misconceptions, and equipping students—particularly those from historically underrepresented backgrounds—with transferable reasoning skills essential for success in pharmacy practice and lifelong learning.

## Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) Framing  
### Design-Based Research Perspective

This teaching repository represents a scholarly approach to instructional design grounded in principles of design-based research (DBR) within the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL). The instructional framework was intentionally constructed to address a recurring challenge in medicinal chemistry education: students’ difficulty translating chemical structure and mechanistic knowledge into clinically meaningful decisions.

To address this gap, the repository applies an iterative design process in which instructional goals, learning activities, and assessments are explicitly aligned to promote structure-based reasoning and therapeutic application. Core medicinal chemistry concepts—pharmacophore identification, physicochemical property analysis, structure–activity relationship interpretation, and metabolism-driven decision-making—are reinforced repeatedly across multiple drug classes within a single therapeutic area.

Assessment artifacts, including Bloom’s-mapped multiple-choice questions, case-based prompts, and a cross-lecture capstone exam, serve both evaluative and diagnostic functions. These tools support continuous instructional refinement and provide evidence of student learning at higher cognitive levels (analysis, evaluation, and synthesis). As a publicly disseminated repository, this work contributes to broader conversations in pharmacy education regarding effective strategies for integrating foundational sciences with professional competencies.

## Teaching Product Description  
### Medicinal Chemistry of Sedative–Hypnotics Instructional Repository

**Product Type:**  
Public-facing instructional repository (lectures, assessments, study guides)

**Description:**  
This teaching product is a comprehensive medicinal chemistry instructional repository focused on sedative–hypnotic drugs, organized by therapeutic area and designed for first-year PharmD students. The repository consists of three modular lecture units covering:  
1. Benzodiazepine sedative–hypnotics  
2. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (Z-drugs)  
3. Alternative hypnotic pathways, including melatonin receptor agonists, orexin receptor antagonists, and barbiturates  

All content is delivered in a reproducible, platform-agnostic Markdown format compatible with modern instructional tools (e.g., Marp, learning management systems, and assessment platforms).

**Pedagogical Purpose:**  
The primary objective of this teaching product is to develop students’ ability to apply medicinal chemistry principles—rather than memorize drug lists—to therapeutic decision-making. Each lecture explicitly integrates pharmacophore recognition, physicochemical properties, structure–activity relationships, intermolecular drug–receptor interactions, and metabolism to explain differences in efficacy, duration of action, safety, and clinical use. Common misconceptions are intentionally surfaced and corrected to strengthen conceptual understanding and reduce superficial learning.

**Assessment and Learning Support:**  
The repository includes a complete assessment suite consisting of Bloom’s-aligned multiple-choice question banks, case-based assessments, an integrative capstone exam, and a student study guide. Assessments are designed to evaluate higher-order cognitive skills and reinforce consistent analytical reasoning across sedative–hypnotic drug classes.

**Impact and Relevance:**  
This teaching product supports Hampton University’s emphasis on high-impact teaching practices, student engagement, and professional preparation. Its modular, reusable design facilitates continuous improvement, cross-course integration, and dissemination as an open educational resource. Collectively, the repository demonstrates a sustained, scholarly commitment to teaching excellence in medicinal chemistry.
