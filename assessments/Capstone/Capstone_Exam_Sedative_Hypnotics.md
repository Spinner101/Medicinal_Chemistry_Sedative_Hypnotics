# PHA 548 — Capstone Exam
## Medicinal Chemistry of Sedative–Hypnotics

**Coverage:**  
Lecture 01 (Benzodiazepines)  
Lecture 02 (Non-BZD Hypnotics)  
Lecture 03 (Alternative Pathways)

**Instructions:**  
Select the BEST answer. Questions require integration of pharmacophore,
SAR, physicochemical properties, metabolism, and therapeutic decision-making.

---

## SECTION I — Mechanism Integration

### Q1
Which drug class promotes sleep primarily by **reducing wake drive rather than enhancing inhibition**?

A. Benzodiazepines  
B. Z-drugs  
C. Barbiturates  
D. **Orexin receptor antagonists** ✅  

---

### Q2
Benzodiazepines require endogenous GABA because they:

A. Are competitive antagonists  
B. Directly gate chloride channels  
C. **Bind allosterically and enhance GABA efficacy** ✅  
D. Block excitatory neurotransmission  

---

## SECTION II — Pharmacophore & SAR

### Q3
Removal of the C7 electron-withdrawing group from a benzodiazepine would MOST likely:

A. Increase potency  
B. Improve metabolic stability  
C. **Reduce receptor affinity** ✅  
D. Convert the drug to an antagonist  

---

### Q4
Which structural feature is most responsible for **ultra-short duration** in remimazolam?

A. Triazolobenzodiazepine core  
B. Ortho-halogenation  
C. **Ester “soft spot” for rapid hydrolysis** ✅  
D. Reduced lipophilicity  

---

### Q5
Z-drugs retain hypnotic efficacy despite lacking a diazepine ring because they:

A. Bind orthosterically  
B. Preferentially activate α2 subunits  
C. **Preserve BZD-site pharmacophore geometry** ✅  
D. Block glutamate receptors  

---

## SECTION III — Physicochemical Properties & PK

### Q6
Which modification would MOST likely increase next-day sedation?

A. Adding a polar hydroxyl group  
B. Removing aromatic rings  
C. **Increasing lipophilicity and metabolic stability** ✅  
D. Introducing ester hydrolysis  

---

### Q7
A hypnotic cleared primarily by aldehyde oxidase would be expected to have:

A. Long duration  
B. Active metabolites  
C. **Short, predictable half-life** ✅  
D. High accumulation risk  

---

## SECTION IV — Therapeutic Decision-Making

### Q8
A patient with cirrhosis requires short-term treatment for insomnia. Which is MOST appropriate?

A. Diazepam  
B. Flurazepam  
C. **Temazepam** ✅  
D. Quazepam  

---

### Q9
Which hypnotic class BEST preserves cognition and motor coordination?

A. Benzodiazepines  
B. Barbiturates  
C. Z-drugs  
D. **Orexin receptor antagonists** ✅  

---

### Q10
A patient with circadian rhythm disorder but minimal anxiety should receive:

A. Zolpidem  
B. Suvorexant  
C. **Tasimelteon** ✅  
D. Triazolam  

---

## SECTION V — Synthesis

### Q11
Why are barbiturates no longer preferred for insomnia?

A. Poor CNS penetration  
B. Low potency  
C. **Direct channel gating and narrow therapeutic index** ✅  
D. Lack of oral bioavailability  

---

### Q12
Which statement BEST explains modern hypnotic drug design?

A. Increased potency improves safety  
B. Target novelty is essential  
C. **PK control often matters more than receptor selectivity** ✅  
D. Sedation equals sleep quality
