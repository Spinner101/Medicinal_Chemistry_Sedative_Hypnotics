# Lecture 03 MCQs — Alternative Hypnotic Pathways

### Q1 (Understand)
Orexin antagonists promote sleep primarily by:
A. Enhancing GABA release  
B. Increasing melatonin synthesis  
C. **Reducing wake drive** ✅  
D. Blocking histamine receptors  

---

### Q2 (Analyze)
Which feature best distinguishes orexin antagonists from GABAergic hypnotics?
A. Sedative potency  
B. **Preservation of sleep architecture** ✅  
C. Faster onset  
D. Higher abuse potential  

---

### Q3 (Apply)
Which agent is most appropriate for insomnia in a patient with a history of benzodiazepine misuse?
A. Zolpidem  
B. Diazepam  
C. **Ramelteon** ✅  
D. Triazolam  

---

### Q4 (Understand)
Melatonin agonists primarily act to:
A. Sedate cortical neurons  
B. **Entraining circadian rhythm** ✅  
C. Block wake neurotransmitters  
D. Enhance REM sleep  

---

### Q5 (Analyze)
Why is half-life tuning critical for orexin antagonists?
A. To increase potency  
B. To avoid CYP metabolism  
C. **To minimize next-day somnolence** ✅  
D. To enhance anxiolysis  

---

### Q6 (Evaluate)
Which misconception is MOST problematic clinically?
A. Orexin antagonists are sedatives  
B. **Melatonin agonists work regardless of timing** ✅  
C. Barbiturates affect GABA  
D. DORAs are dual antagonists  

---

### Q7 (Analyze)
Barbiturates differ fundamentally from benzodiazepines because they:
A. Bind the same allosteric site  
B. Increase channel opening frequency  
C. **Can directly gate the GABA_A channel** ✅  
D. Require endogenous GABA  

---

### Q8 (Apply)
Which hypnotic class best preserves cognition and motor coordination?
A. Benzodiazepines  
B. Z-drugs  
C. **Orexin antagonists** ✅  
D. Barbiturates  

---

### Q9 (Evaluate)
Why are barbiturates now limited in insomnia treatment?
A. Low potency  
B. Poor oral absorption  
C. **Narrow therapeutic index** ✅  
D. Lack of efficacy  

---

### Q10 (Synthesize)
A patient with circadian rhythm disorder and minimal anxiety should receive:
