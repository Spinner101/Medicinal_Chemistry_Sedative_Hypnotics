# Lecture 02 MCQs — Non-Benzodiazepine Sedative-Hypnotics

### Q1 (Understand)
Z-drugs differ structurally from benzodiazepines but share which key feature?
A. Diazepine ring  
B. Orthosteric GABA binding  
C. BZD-site allosteric modulation ✅  
D. Direct chloride channel opening  

---

### Q2 (Analyze)
Z-drugs preferentially produce hypnosis rather than anxiolysis because they:
A. Avoid the GABA_A receptor  
B. Preferentially engage α1 subunits ✅  
C. Increase channel opening duration  
D. Block GABA synthesis  

---

### Q3 (Apply)
Which Z-drug is most appropriate for **middle-of-the-night awakening**?
A. Zolpidem  
B. Eszopiclone  
C. **Zaleplon** ✅  
D. Diazepam  

---

### Q4 (Analyze)
Which structural feature most strongly contributes to zaleplon’s ultra-short duration?
A. High lipophilicity  
B. Active metabolites  
C. Aldehyde oxidase metabolism ✅  
D. C3–OH substitution  

---

### Q5 (Evaluate)
Which misconception about Z-drugs is MOST clinically dangerous?
A. They lack anxiolytic activity  
B. They have short half-lives  
C. **They do not cause dependence** ✅  
D. They bind GABA_A receptors  

---

### Q6 (Analyze)
Increasing lipophilicity of a Z-drug would MOST likely result in:
A. Reduced CNS penetration  
B. Shorter duration  
C. **Greater next-day impairment** ✅  
D. Loss of BZD-site binding  

---

### Q7 (Apply)
Which Z-drug is best suited for **sleep maintenance**?
A. Zaleplon  
B. **Eszopiclone** ✅  
C. Zolpidem  
D. Triazolam  

---

### Q8 (Evaluate)
Z-drugs were designed primarily to:
A. Eliminate GABAergic effects  
B. Treat anxiety disorders  
C. **Control duration via PK rather than receptor novelty** ✅  
D. Avoid CNS penetration  

---

### Q9 (Analyze)
Which SAR modification would most likely **shorten duration**?
A. Increased aromaticity  
B. Blocking oxidation  
C. **Adding polar substituents** ✅  
D. Increasing lipophilicity  

---

### Q10 (Apply)
A patient experiences metallic taste with a hypnotic. Which drug is most likely responsible?
A. Zolpidem  
B. Zaleplon  
C. **Eszopiclone** ✅  
D. Temazepam
